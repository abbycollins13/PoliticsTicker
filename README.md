#PoliticsTicker

This bot retweets the latest tweet using the "#politics" hashtag. It attempts to retweet once per hour.

It posts a new tweet targeted to the twitter user that it just retweeted with the message: “That’s an interesting opinion. Why don’t you try this one: ” After the message I attach a link to a news article that I created from an array. These articles are from reputable sources that have different political affiliations. I included articles from New York Times, Fox, CNN, The Huffington Post, etc. My twitter bot will also respond to mentions with the message “Keep engaging with the political community and don't forget to vote!”, favorite tweets that have ‘unbiased politics’ in the tweet, and follow a mentioner. By targeting twitter accounts that focus on politics, PolitcsTicker attempts to create community of conversations about the news that are varied and interesting.

The nohup command was run, so the bot will automatically continue to post.
